I just tested this script that i bought from fiverr.com and it's working fine, i reached the 500 request daily limit from
forvo but this script will be able to start from this point tomorrow. I asked for a simple interface so anyone without code
skills (like me) could operate. 

Steps to use:
1.Download python software from the oficial website and proceed with the full instalation marking all the options 
(IDLE is the most important):
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-amd64.exe

2. Make sure you have google chrome in your system since its suited only for Chrome and download the chrome driver to
the same folder of the script:
http://chromedriver.chromium.org/

3. Finally run memrise_forvo.py which is your main file. Do that by right clicking the script file (memrise_forvo.py)
and selecting "Edit with IDLE"

4. You gonna see the code and you should press F5 to run the code.

5. Once you run the code you gonna see the little interface asking for the forvo API code and for the language in which you
wish to upload the audio. I purchased the less expensive key and it cost me 12 bucks (2usd/month during 6 months) allowing
500 requests per day. Just copy and paste the API code and select the language: https://api.forvo.com/account/

6. That's it. Once you press "Do It" it will open a new Chrome Window so you can log into your memrise account and reach
the edit screen. The script will ask to press 1 to a fresh start and to press 0 if you are continuing from where you stop last
time and for that it will create a file called track.txt on this same folder.

7. That's it. I hope this tool can help more people just as it helped me. This is the profile of the guy the kindly did this
script for me for a pretty fair price, so if you are needing some king of memrise automation this is the guy you should look
for: https://www.fiverr.com/lovish_bathla

* The next step will be autoupload script/handwritten ( **ktav ivri rahut** in hebrew) images from the standard quadratic
form so people can be tested with that as well on memrise. 

** I also thought about some kind of illustration database for the given words since our brain is much more visual but i didn't
found any API that provides good and standard illustrations for any given english word. Its important that the images share
the same pattern of color, size and style so we can use the database for any given Memrise course.
